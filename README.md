An addon for the [TuyaGateway][tuyagateway] application. TuyaGateway listens on MQTT topics and routes requests to your Tuya devices. In earlier versions the configuration was based on a one to one topic translation in e.g. Home-Assistant
config-files.

Also included is [GismoCaster][gismocaster], which offers a webinterface in which you can add/alter/delete devices and setup the dps properties. This configuration is written to your MQTT broker as a retain message. TuyaGateway and Home Assistant are listening for these autodiscovery topics.


## About
